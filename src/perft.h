 * \brief Defines an object for Perft execution
 *
 * The Perft object encapsulates the perft algorithm that can
 * be used to determine the number of moves that be generated
 * from a chess position.
 *
 * The level of the perft defines the depth
 * at which the perft will be performed. For example, a perft level
 * of 1 will generate all moves for the player whose turn it is
 * to move. A perft level of 2 will generate all moves for the current
 * player as well as all response moves from the other player. Levels
 * beyond that work similarly.
 *
 * The perft algorithm can be used to both validate move generators
 * as well as quantify their performance.
